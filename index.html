                            <p>
                                My name is Van Nguyen, I have an interest in IT which began in year 10.
                                During work experience as an IT assistant, I had the opportunity to assist in
                                downloading drivers,
                                disassembling and assembling desktop PC parts.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                My passion to pursue IT grew even further when a friend from university introduced me to
                                ‘Linux’, a
                                free operating system when I was student studying Engineering.
                                During my studies, I felt the Engineering course was not the right fit for me once I
                                began playing
                                around with the ‘Linux’ program on an old PC.
                                In addition, I unfortunately dropped out of my Engineering course due to my mental
                                health issue.
                                During that time, I had worked for two years before attempting to figure out what I
                                truly wanted to
                                pursue in life.
                                My little sister helped lead my decision to chase my dream job as IT specialist as I
                                spend most of
                                my time with computers.
                                This led me to study diploma of IT at VU and further finding my love of configurating
                                live ‘Linux
                                servers (AWS)’.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I started to 3 build gaming because I love playing games in my spare time. I do not have
                                friends
                                to spend time with. I also spend time fixing android phones and laptops. One of the
                                satisfying
                                things when fixing computers/laptops and android phones is that they can function again
                                from a
                                dead/nonfunction state.

                        I choose VU because I wanted to become a front-end developer. From looking at the website for
                        other
                        university. The
                        Victoria University website is excellently made compared the other university. I am there to
                        study
                        and gain
                        experience in web and application development major. And gain valuable knowledge to get myself
                        learning new things
                        to build up my dream.

                        <strong>Factor I</strong>
                        was labelled as Extroversion by the developers of the IPIP-BFFM. Factor I is sometimes given
                        other names, such as Surgency or Positive Emotionality.
                        Individuals who score high on Factor I one are outgoing and social. Individuals who score low
                        tend to be shut ins.

                        <strong> Factor II</strong>
                        is labeled as Emotional Stability. Factor II is often referred to by other names, such as
                        Neruoticism or Negative Emotionality (in these two cases interpretations are inverted, as
                        Neruoticism and Negative Emotionality can be though of as the opposite of Emotional Stability).

                        <strong>Factor III</strong>
                        is labeled as Agreeableness. A person high in agreeableness is friendly and optimistic. Low
                        scorers are critical and aggressive

                        <strong>Factor IV</strong>
                        is labeled as Conscientiousness. Individuals who score high on this factor are careful and
                        diligent. Low scorers are impulsive and disorganized.

                        <strong>Factor V</strong>
                        is labeled as Intellect/Imagination. This factor is also often called Openness to Experience.
                        People who score low tend to be traditional and conventional.
