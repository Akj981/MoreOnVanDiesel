                        My name is Van Nguyen, I have an interest in IT which began in year 10.
                        During work experience as an IT assistant, I had the opportunity to assist in downloading drivers, disassembling and assembling desktop PC parts.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My passion to pursue IT grew even further when a friend from university introduced me to ‘Linux’, a free operating system when I was student studying Engineering.
                        During my studies, I felt the Engineering course was not the right fit for me once I began playing around with the ‘Linux’ program on an old PC.
                        In addition, I unfortunately dropped out of my Engineering course due to my mental health issue.
                        During that time, I had worked for two years before attempting to figure out what I truly wanted to pursue in life.
                        My little sister helped lead my decision to chase my dream job as IT specialist as I spend most of my time with computers.
                        This led me to study diploma of IT at VU and further finding my love of configurating live  ‘Linux servers (AWS)’.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    I started to 3 build gaming because I love playing games in my spare time. I do not have friends
                    to spend time with. I also spend time fixing android phones and laptops. One of the satisfying
                    things when fixing computers/laptops and android phones is that they can function again from a
                    dead/nonfunction state.

                    <p>
                    I choose RMIT because I would like to find like minded people (independent learners) and different
                    mentality of studying. Felt the other university was copy and paste but stop the students from using
                    their own brain to troubleshoot programming problems.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    I do not like spoon feed as I noticed how bad
                    students cannot think for themselves once they quickly ask for help when they didn’t try solving
                    their own problem or look up for answer online forms. Felt that bullying is common at my other
                    university. So, I avoid it all together.

                        That I will grow with others and gain valuable materials from studying with RMIT. Also, I avoided
                    networking courses because I didn’t like it as much as physically connecting a lot of cables to
                    servers based on a schematic diagram.
