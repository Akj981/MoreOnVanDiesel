                <p>
                    My interest in IT started when I finished my work experience in year 10 as an IT assistant. Simples
                    stuff such as downloading drivers, disassembling and assembling desktop PC parts. My interest grew
                    even further when my friend from university introduced me to Linux as a free operating system when I
                    was a student studying engineering. But I felt I was not studying the right course when I started to
                    play around with Linux on an old pc.</p>

                <p> I dropped out of engineering due to mental health issues.
                    Worked 2 years before going back to studies to figure out what I wanted to do. My sister was the one
                    that mentioned I spend most of my time with computers. So, I end up trying out a diploma of IT at VU
                    to see if I like IT. From my studies in diploma in IT, I see that I have strengths/likes and
                    weaknesses/dislikes in IT. end up hating the theory in computer networking but love the
                    configuration of live Linux servers (AWS). </p>
                <p>
                    I started to 3 build gaming because I love playing games in my spare time when I do not have friends
                    to spend time with. I also spend time fixing android phones and laptops. One of the satisfying
                    things when fixing computers/laptops and android phones is that they can function again from a
                    dead/nonfunction state.

                </p>

                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>I choose RMIT because I would like to find like minded people (independent learners) and different
                    mentality of studying. Felt the other university was copy and paste but stop the students from using
                    their own brain to troubleshoot programming problems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I do not like spoon feed as I noticed how bad
                    students cannot think for themselves once they quickly ask for help when they didn’t try solving
                    their own problem or look up for answer online forms. Felt that bullying is common at my other
                    university. So, I avoid it all together.
                </p>

                </div>
                <p>That I will grow with others and gain valuable materials from studying with RMIT. Also, I avoided
                    networking courses because I didn’t like it as much as physically connecting a lot of cables to
                    servers based on a schematic diagram.
